#
# Argus will open this argus.conf if its installed as /etc/argus.conf.
# It will also search for this file as argus.conf in directories
# specified in $ARGUSPATH, or $ARGUSHOME, $ARGUSHOME/lib,
# or $HOME, $HOME/lib, and parse it to set common configuration
# options.  All values in this file can be overriden by command

# Variable Explanations
#
# The Argus can be configured to support a large number of
# flow types.  The Argus can provide either type, i.e.
# uni-directional or bi-directional flow tracking and
# the flow can be further defined by specifying the key.
# The argus supports a set of well known key strategies,
# such as 'CLASSIC_5_TUPLE', 'LAYER_3_MATRIX', 'LAYER_2_MATRIX',
# 'MPLS', and/or 'VLAN', or the argus can be configured to
# formulate key strategies from a list of the specific
# objects that the Argus understands.  See the man page for
# a complete description.
#
# The default is the classic 5-tuple IP flow, CLASSIC_5_TUPLE.
#

# Argus is capable of running as a daemon, doing all the right things
# that daemons do.  When this configuration is used for the system
# daemon process, say for /etc/argus.conf, this variable should be
# set to "yes".
#
# The default value is to not run as a daemon.
#
# This example is to support the ./support/Startup/argus script
# which works when this variable be set to "yes".
#
# Commandline equivalent   -d
#

#ARGUS_DAEMON=no


# Argus Monitor Data is uniquely identifiable based on the source
# identifier that is included in each output record.  This is to
# allow you to work with Argus Data from multiple monitors at the
# same time.  The ID is 32 bits long, and so legitimate values are
# 0 - 4294967296 but argus also supports IP addresses as values.
# The configuration allows for you to use host names, however, do
# have some understanding how `hostname` will be resolved by the
# nameserver before commiting to this strategy completely.
#
# For convenience, argus supports the notion of "`hostname`" for
# assigning the probe's id.  This is to support management of
# large deployments, so you can have one argus.conf file that works
# for a lot of probes.
#
# For security, argus does not rely on system programs, like hostname.1,
# It implements the logic of hostname itself, so don't try to run
# arbitrary programs using this method, because it won't work.

# Argus monitors can provide a real-time remote access port
# for collecting Argus data.  This is a TCP based port service and
# the default port number is tcp/561, the "experimental monitor"
# service.  This feature is disabled by default, and can be forced
# off by setting it to zero (0).
#
# When you do want to enable this service, 561 is a good choice,
# as all ra* clients are configured to try this port by default.
#
# Commandline equivalent   -P
#

#ARGUS_ACCESS_PORT=561
ARGUS_ACCESS_PORT=902


# When remote access is enabled (see above), you can specify that Argus
# should bind only to a specific IP address. This is useful, for example,
# in restricting access to the local host, or binding to a private
# interface while capturing from another.
#
# You can provide multiple addresses, separated by commas, or on multiple
# lines.
#
# The default is to bind to any IP address.
#
# Commandline equivalent  -B
#

#ARGUS_BIND_IP="::1,127.0.0.1"
#ARGUS_BIND_IP="127.0.0.1"

# By default, Argus will open the first appropriate interface on a
# system that it encounters.  For systems that have only one network
# interface, this is a reasonable thing to do.  But, when there are
# more than one suitable interface, you should specify the
# interface(s) Argus should use either on the command line or in this
# file.
#
# Argus can track packets from any or all interfaces, concurrently.
# The interfaces can be tracked as:
#   1.  independant - this is where argus tracks flows from each
#          interface independant from the packets seen on any other
#          interface.  This is useful for hosts/routers that
#          have full-duplex interfaces, and you want to distinguish
#          flows based on their interface. There is an option to specify
#          a distinct srcid to each independant modeler.
#
#   2.  duplex - where argus tracks packets from 2 interfaces
#          as if they were two half duplex streams of the same link.
#          Because there is a single modeler tracking the 2
#          interfaces, there is a single srcid that can be passed as
#          an option.
#
#   3.  bonded - where argus tracks packets from multiple interfaces
#          as if they were from the same stream.  Because there is a
#          single modeler tracking the 2 interfaces, there is a single
#          srcid that can be passed as an option.
#
#  Interfaces can be specified as groups using '[',']' notation, to build
#  flexible definitions of packet sources.  However, each interface
#  should be referenced only once (this is due to performance and OS
#  limitations, so if your OS has no problem with this, go ahead).
#
#  The lo (loopback) interface will be included only if it is specifically
#  indicated in the option.
#
#  The syntax for specifying this either on the command line or in this file:
#     -i ind:all
#     -i dup:en0,en1/srcid
#     -i bond:en0,en1/srcid
#     -i dup:[bond:en0,en1],en2/srcid
#     -i en0/srcid -i en1/srcid            (equivalent '-i ind:en0/srcid,en1/srcid')
#     -i en0 en1                           (equivalent '-i bond:en0,en1')
#     -i en1(dlt)/srcid -i en1(dlt)/srcid
#
#  In all cases, if there is a "-e srcid" provided, the srcid provided is used
#  as the default.  If a srcid is specified using this option, it overrides
#  the default.
#

# By default, Argus will put its interface in promiscuous mode
# in order to monitor all the traffic that can be collected.
# This can put an undo load on systems. 
 
# If the intent is to monitor only the network activity of
# the specific system, say to measure the performance of
# an HTTP service or DNS service, you'll want to turn 
# promiscuous mode off.
#
# The default value is go into prmiscuous mode.

#
 
#ARGUS_GO_PROMISCUOUS=yes


# Argus supports chroot(2) in order to control the file system that
# argus exists in and can access.  Generally used when argus is running
# with privileges, this limits the negative impacts that argus could
# inflict on its host machine. 
#
# This option will cause the output file names to be relative to this
# directory, and so consider this when trying to find your output files.

#ARGUS_CHROOT_DIR=/chroot_dir


# Argus can be configured to enable detailed control plane
# flow monitoring for specific control plane protocols.
#
# This feature requires full packet capture for the monitored
# interface in order to capture the complete control plane
# protocol, and will have a performance impact on the sensor.
#
# The default is to not turn this feature on.
#
# Commandline equivalent   -C

# Argus can be directed to change its user id using the setuid() system
# call.  This is can used when argus is started as root, in order to
# access privileged resources, but then after the resources are opened,
# this directive will cause argus to change its user id value to
# a 'lesser' capable account.  Recommended when argus is running as

#ARGUS_SETUSER_ID=user


# Argus can be directed to change its group id using the setgid() system
# call.  This is can used when argus is started as root, in order to

# Argus can write its output to one or a number of files.
# The default limit is 5 concurrent files, each with their
# own independant filters.
#
# The format is:
#      ARGUS_OUTPUT_FILE=/full/path/file/name
#      ARGUS_OUTPUT_FILE="/full/path/file/name filter"
#
# Most sites will have argus write to a file, for reliablity.

# this file (with any chroot'd directory prepended).
#
# Commandline equivalent   -w

#ARGUS_OUTPUT_FILE=/var/log/argus/argus.out


# Argus can push its output to one or a number of remote hosts.
# The default limit is 5 concurrent output streams, each with their
# own independant filters.
#
# The format is:

#      ARGUS_OUTPUT_STREAN="argus-udp://multicastGroup:port
#      ARGUS_OUTPUT_STREAN="argus-udp://host:port 'tcp and not udp'"
#
# Most sites will have argus listen() for remote sites to request argus data, 
# using a "pull" data model.  But for some sites and applications, pushing
# records without explicit registration is desired.  This option will cause
# argus to transmit records that match the optional filter, to the configured
# targets using UDP as the transport mechanism.
# 
# The primary purpose for this feature is to multicast argus records to
# a number of listeners on an interface, but it is not limited to this
# purpose. The multicast TTL is set to 128 by default, so that you can
# send records some distance.

# When Argus is configured to run as a daemon, with the -d
# option, Argus can store its pid in a file, to aid in
# managing the running daemon.  However, creating a system
# pid file requires priviledges that may not be appropriate
# for all cases.
#
# When configured to generate a pid file, if Argus cannot
# create the pid file, it will fail to run.  This variable
# is available to override the default, in case this gets

# multiple status reports into the activity of a flow.  The
# default is 5 seconds, but this number may be too low or
# too high depending on your uses.  Argus does suppport
# a minimum value of 0.000001 seconds.  Values under 1 sec
# are very useful for doing measurements in a controlled
